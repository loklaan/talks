# Documenting Components

_Components are so easy to start writing that sometimes it’s more of a hassle to find, understand, and reuse an existing component._

**But I push for reuse in UI.** I think re-writing components isn’t always justified and often isn't a good use of your time here on earth.

So, one of the best ways we can contribute to reuse of components is to make them easier to:

1. **Discover**
2. **Understand**
3. **Experiment**
4. **...And Use!**
